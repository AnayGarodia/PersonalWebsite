          <h1>The Beauty of Group Theory</h1>

        <div class="article-content">
          <p>
            When I first encountered group theory at Stanford SUMaC this summer,
            I honestly wasn't expecting much—just another abstract math topic.
            But it ended up being one of the coolest things I've learned. The
            way it connects so many different areas of math is pretty wild.
          </p>

          <h2>What Are Groups?</h2>

          <p>
            A group is basically a set with an operation that combines elements,
            and it needs to follow four rules: closure, associativity, identity,
            and invertibility. Sounds simple, but the implications are huge.
          </p>

          <p>
            Take integers with addition. Add any two integers and you get
            another integer (closure). Grouping doesn't matter—(a + b) + c = a +
            (b + c) (associativity). Zero is the identity element. Every number
            has an inverse (its negative). Boom, that's a group.
          </p>

          <h2>Symmetry Everywhere</h2>

          <p>
            What makes group theory really cool is how it describes symmetry.
            Think about a square—you can rotate it or flip it, and it still
            looks like a square. Those transformations form a group called D₄
            with eight elements.
          </p>

          <p>
            This same framework shows up in crystallography for describing
            crystal structures, in chemistry for molecular symmetries, and in
            physics for conservation laws through Noether's theorem. It's like
            finding the same pattern repeated everywhere.
          </p>

          <h3>Hidden Connections</h3>

          <p>
            The more I've learned, the more connections I've found. The rotation
            group SO(3) that describes rotations in 3D space connects to quantum
            mechanics and particle spin. Galois theory uses groups to explain
            which polynomial equations can be solved with radicals—answering a
            question mathematicians worked on for centuries.
          </p>

          <h2>Practical Applications</h2>

          <p>
            Group theory isn't just theoretical. RSA encryption, which secures
            most of the internet, relies on properties of multiplicative groups.
            Error-correcting codes in everything from CDs to spacecraft use
            group-theoretic foundations.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I was working on my AI sentience testing research, I found
            myself thinking about transformation invariance—how certain
            properties should stay the same under specific transformations. This
            relates to how neural networks learn and how we might evaluate
            different types of intelligence.
          </p>

          <h2>Learning to Think Differently</h2>

          <p>
            The best part of studying group theory wasn't memorizing theorems—it
            was learning to think at the right level of abstraction. Instead of
            focusing on specific examples, you learn to identify common
            structure. A rotation of a square and a permutation of numbers might
            seem totally different, but they're instances of the same pattern.
          </p>

          <p>
            This kind of thinking has helped me in CS and physics too. Looking
            for underlying group structure often makes problems clearer.
          </p>

          <h2>What's Next</h2>

          <p>
            There's so much more to explore. Representation theory connects
            group theory to linear algebra by representing groups as matrices.
            Lie groups describe continuous symmetries and are fundamental to
            modern physics. And category theory generalizes all of this even
            further (though that's a rabbit hole for another time).
          </p>

          <p>
            What keeps me interested is how group theory shows the power of
            abstraction. By stripping away unnecessary details and focusing on
            structure, you gain insights that would be impossible to see
            otherwise.
          </p>

          <h2>Further Reading</h2>

          <p>
            If you want to learn more, I'd recommend Artin's "Algebra" for the
            rigorous stuff, or Armstrong's "Groups and Symmetry" for a more
            geometric approach. For physics applications, Zee's "Group Theory in
            a Nutshell for Physicists" is great.
          </p>

          <p>
            There's always more to discover—more connections to make, deeper
            patterns to find. Group theory has been one of those areas where
            each new concept opens up entirely new ways of seeing math.
