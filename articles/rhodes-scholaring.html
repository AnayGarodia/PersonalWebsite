          <p>
            On January 21, 2016, Rhodes Scholar Ntokozo Qwabe, a South African
            law student, rose to speak at the Oxford Union debate on whether
            Cecil Rhodes's statue should remain at Oriel College. Rhodes, the
            nineteenth-century British mining magnate who extracted wealth from
            southern Africa using forced labor, endowed the Rhodes Scholarship
            in 1902 explicitly to "further the British Empire" and cultivate
            leaders spreading what he called Anglo-Saxon dominance. His statue
            has stood at Oriel College since 1911 and his scholarships remain
            among the world's most prestigious.
          </p>

          <div class="image-caption">

          </div>

          <p>
            Before Qwabe could begin his prepared remarks, he had to address
            what he called "the backlash against me particularly because I am on
            the Rhodes scholarship." Critics across British media had attacked
            him for days. The Guardian quoted an Oxford alumnus who called
            Qwabe's position "the height of hypocrisy." A member of Parliament
            tweeted: "If Cecil Rhodes is so offensive, give back the
            scholarship." The Times ran a profile of Qwabe's father, a retired
            school caretaker in rural KwaZulu-Natal, emphasizing that Qwabe had
            grown up herding cattle. The implication was clear: he should be
            grateful, not biting the hand that fed him. One commenter told him
            to "go back to the continent," invoking, as Qwabe put it, "the same
            tropes that basically the likes of Rhodes did."
          </p>

          <p>
            The critics treat Qwabe's position as a contradiction: either accept
            the money and honor Rhodes, or reject both. But Qwabe responded: "I
            will not be told that I am a hypocrite for taking money that was
            stolen from my people." The Rhodes Must Fall movement, which began
            at the University of Cape Town in 2015 calling for the
            decolonization of education, emerged precisely because
            decolonization cannot happen from outside colonial institutions.
            Students at formerly colonial universities inhabit buildings,
            curricula, and degree-granting systems built by colonialists using
            extracted wealth. The movement asks what happens when you occupy
            compromised ground and speak anyway.
          </p>

          <p>
            The intensity of the backlash reveals what Oxford wants to hide: the
            Scholarship and the statue come from the same source, honor the same
            man, and are funded by the same violence. Oxford's institutional
            response demonstrates this separation strategy. When Rhodes Must
            Fall protests intensified, Oxford kept the scholarships running
            while forming committees to "contextualize" the statue, eventually
            retaining it with added plaques. The scholarship functions as
            reputation laundering: it allows Oxford to benefit from Rhodes's
            colonial wealth while positioning itself as progressive through its
            "diverse" scholar cohort. But Qwabe's presence as a Rhodes Scholar
            arguing Rhodes Must Fall makes this contradiction visible. Oxford
            cannot partially honor Rhodes and benefit from his wealth while
            claiming to reject his racism.
          </p>

          <h2>What Grammar Teaches Us About Power</h2>

          <p>
            Robin Wall Kimmerer's meditation on Potawatomi grammar offers an
            unexpected lens for understanding what Qwabe does. Kimmerer, a
            Potawatomi botanist, describes in "Learning the Grammar of Animacy"
            the experience of learning her ancestral language. She struggles
            with the Potawatomi's verb-heavy structure, which expresses concepts
            that are nouns or adjectives in English. She encounters
            <em>wiikwegama</em> – "to be a bay." A bay, she thought, is a noun:
            a geographic feature, a thing. In English, saying "it is a bay"
            treats water as an object fixed between shores, contained by the
            word. But in Potawatomi, "to be a bay" treats water as acting, as
            choosing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Kimmerer writes: "To be a bay holds the wonder that for this moment,
            the living water has decided to shelter itself between these shores,
            conversing with cedar roots and a flock of baby mergansers. Because
            it could do otherwise." The verb form recognizes possibility. The
            water could flow to the ocean, could evaporate, could become a
            stream.
          </p>

          <p>
            This grammatical difference is ontological: it distinguishes between
            treating something as a fixed object versus an active being capable
            of choice. This difference, Kimmerer argues, has ethical
            consequences. "When we tell them that the tree is not a 'who,' but
            an 'it,' we make that maple an object, we put a barrier between us.
            We set it outside our circle of ethical concern." If the maple is
            "it," you can cut it without thought. If the maple is "she," if she
            is actively maple-ing, you hesitate. The verb creates relationship,
            therefore responsibility.
          </p>

          <h2>From Noun to Verb</h2>

          <p>
            This grammatical insight illuminates what Qwabe does at Oxford. The
            institution treats "Rhodes Scholar" as a noun, a fixed identity
            conferring specific obligations. The Rhodes Trust describes scholars
            as embodying the values Rhodes himself held dear: leadership, moral
            character, public service. The category assumes gratitude, defines
            what you are and what you owe.
          </p>

          <p>
            But when Qwabe stands as "Rhodes Scholar" arguing Rhodes Must Fall,
            he breaks this mold. He is not confined by the category but acting
            through it. He is <em>Rhodes Scholaring</em>, and he is <em>Rhodes Scholaring</em>
            against Rhodes. The noun becomes a verb. He explains: "Those of us
            from southern Africa who take the money of the Rhodes scholarship do
            so because we are here for change. We are here to take back the
            money. We are here to at least have some dignity that we take away
            from that undignifying dispossession and plunder that the likes of
            Rhodes committed on the continent." The category does what it was
            never designed to do: not honoring Rhodes but indicting him, not
            celebrating the empire but demanding reparations. As Qwabe puts it:
            "We can NEVER be 'hypocrites' for taking back crumbs of the colonial
            loot of Rhodes and his colonial cronies."
          </p>

          </div>

          <p>
            Treating "Rhodes Scholar" as a verb rather than a noun changes the
            ethical relationship. Just as Kimmerer argues that calling the maple
            "it" places it "outside our circle of ethical concern," treating
            "Rhodes Scholar" as a fixed noun creates an ethical relationship of
            debt. The scholar is what Rhodes made possible; therefore the
            scholar owes Rhodes honor, or at minimum silence. But treating it as
            a verb, as action the scholar performs, opens the question of how
            that action unfolds and toward what ends. Qwabe insists: "I think
            this idea that money can somehow buy our silence is exactly what the
            problem is. This is exactly what we are confronting." He <em>Rhodes
            Scholars</em> toward different ends than the Rhodes Trust expects. The
            category cannot contain what he does with it.
          </p>

          <h2>The Problem of Colonial Language</h2>

          <p>
            Jamaica Kincaid, the Antigua-born writer whose work examines
            Caribbean colonial history, confronts a parallel bind in "In
            History." Taking up gardening in Vermont, she finds herself forced
            to use Latin botanical names like "Eupatorium" despite resenting
            their colonial origins. She prefers common names, but Latin names
            structure the entire field. To garden seriously requires accepting
            them. Here, Kimmerer's insight about language becomes Kincaid's
            lived constraint: verb-based animacy in Potawatomi imagines
            relationships that English grammar forecloses, but Kincaid cannot
            access alternative naming systems. She must use the colonizer's
            taxonomy or remain outside botanical discourse entirely.
          </p>

          <p>
            Carl Linnaeus created the binomial system in the eighteenth century
            while working for George Clifford, a director of the Dutch East
            India Company. This history is often softened, she notes, hiding the
            fact that Clifford directed the violent extraction of resources from
            colonized lands. Linnaeus named plants in Clifford's greenhouses,
            plants taken from Java, Ceylon, the Cape of Good Hope. The
            scientific names carry this history whether botanists acknowledge it
            or not.
          </p>

          <p>
            Kincaid writes: "In almost every account of an event that has taken
            place sometime in the last five hundred years, there is always a
            moment when I feel like placing an asterisk somewhere in its text,
            and at the end of this official story place my own addition." She
            has just placed that asterisk. When she now writes "Eupatorium,"
            readers see Clifford's greenhouse, the Company, the ships, and the
            violence.
          </p>

          <p>
            Both Kincaid and Qwabe operate within systems they critique,
            exposing what institutions want hidden. But the mechanisms differ.
            Kincaid adds historical context to existing categories. "Eupatorium"
            still refers to the same plant; she expands what readers know about
            the name but cannot change how taxonomy functions. Qwabe, however,
            transforms what "Rhodes Scholar" can mean. By using the scholarship
            to condemn Rhodes, he makes the category do something it was
            designed to prevent. Kincaid adds a footnote while Qwabe tries to
            redefine the category itself.
          </p>

          <h2>Living in the Contradiction</h2>

          <p>
            Kincaid never resolves her opening question: "What to call the thing
            that happened to me and all who look like me? Should I call it
            history?" This refusal to settle does work. As long as the question
            remains unresolved, readers cannot forget that language is
            inadequate, preventing them from treating "history" as neutral or
            sufficient. Qwabe creates similar openness. His position, neither
            grateful beneficiary nor pure outsider, forces Oxford to confront
            what it wants closed: Can Rhodes be honored partially? Oxford wants
            to celebrate his philanthropy while acknowledging his "problematic"
            views, to keep the scholarships while adding "context" plaques. But
            every time Qwabe speaks as Rhodes Scholar against Rhodes, he reopens
            the question. The contradiction becomes visible again.
          </p>

            src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b0fd/live/95680110-e2f9-11ef-a319-fb4e7360c4ec.jpg.webp"
            alt="Cecil Rhodes statue at Oriel College"

          />
          <div class="image-caption">
            The Cecil Rhodes statue at Oriel College, Oxford, which remains in
            place despite protests
          </div>

          <p>
            The risk in this argument is romanticizing Qwabe's position, as
            though occupying colonial categories from within offers an easy path
            to decolonization. It does not. Kincaid captures the exhaustion of
            this position when she describes learning Latin names: "The threads
            in my brain were all knotted and the harder I tried the tighter the
            knots became." Using colonial categories requires constant
            negotiation with their violent histories. The work is never
            complete. Kincaid still writes "Eupatorium" even after placing her
            asterisk. Qwabe still accepts Rhodes's money even as he argues
            Rhodes Must Fall. The scholarship continues. But what else is
            available?
          </p>

          <h2>The Illusion of Choice</h2>

          <p>
            The question "How can you take his money and demand his erasure?"
            assumes that Qwabe possesses real choice. He could refuse the Rhodes
            Scholarship and speak from outside Oxford. But from outside he would
            have no platform at the Oxford Union, no power to force the
            institution to confront its own contradictions. Rhodes's influence
            shaped southern African education systems and access to universities
            worldwide. Refusing the scholarship does not escape Rhodes's
            influence; it only reduces power to challenge it.
          </p>

          <p>
            The critics want Qwabe silent or absent. They want him either
            grateful, thus legitimating Rhodes, or gone, thus invisible. What
            they cannot accept is Qwabe <em>Rhodes Scholaring</em>: using Rhodes's name
            to dismantle his reputation, thereby refusing the very terms of the
            choice the institution offers. As he writes in his Facebook response
            to critics: "Oxford is as much MY institution as anyone else. So
            called 'British institutions' were built and have continued to be
            sustained on the colonial plunder of MY resources, and on the labour
            of MY people who were enslaved. These are OUR institutions and we
            have every right to challenge them to change."
          </p>

          <h2>Making the Invisible Visible</h2>

          <p>
            Kimmerer writes that Potawatomi grammar constitutes "a mirror for
            seeing the animacy of the world, for the life that pulses through
            all things." The language makes visible what English obscures: that
            water acts, that plants choose, that the world is full of beings
            rather than objects. What Qwabe does is similar: he makes visible
            what Oxford's language obscures. "Rhodes Scholar" in institutional
            usage treats Rhodes's wealth as a neutral resource available for
            "good" purposes like education. The institution wanted to use Qwabe,
            a Black South African student benefiting from Rhodes's "generosity",
            as evidence that Rhodes's legacy transcends his racism. Qwabe
            refuses this use. His presence proves that Rhodes's legacy is
            Rhodes's racism, and benefiting from colonial wealth does not
            require honoring colonialism.
          </p>

          <p>
            The work of <em>Rhodes Scholaring</em>, of occupying colonial categories
            while refusing their categorization, is work without end. It does
            not resolve. Kincaid asks her opening question again at the essay's
            close: "what to call the thing that happened to me and all who look
            like me? Should I call it history?" The repetition shows the
            question cannot be answered with existing language. But the
            inability to answer does not mean inability to act. Kincaid gardens.
            She uses Latin names while revealing their origins. She writes
            essays that place asterisks in official histories. Qwabe accepts the
            scholarship, speaks at Oxford, and argues for the statue's removal.
            He <em>Rhodes Scholars</em> without letting "Rhodes Scholar" define him. The
            category breaks under pressure of what he makes it do, revealing
            that colonial categories were never as stable as institutions
            pretended. If "Rhodes Scholar" can mean what Qwabe makes it mean,
            other transformations become thinkable. The water could do
            otherwise. The scholar is doing otherwise. The verb opens futures
            the noun foreclosed.
