        <div class="article-content">
          <p>
            In her essay "Tell Me How It Ends," Valeria Luiselli narrates her
            experience working as an interpreter in an immigration court in New
            York, where she helps unaccompanied child migrants navigate a
            forty-question intake form that will determine their legal fate. She
            plays the role of a compassionate intermediary, translating the
            children's stories which are "shuffled, stuttered, and shattered
            beyond the repair of a narrative order … [with] no beginning, no
            middle, and no end" to "written words, succinct sentences, and
            barren terms." The essay seems to follow the traditional testimonial
            structure where the writer tries to expose the unfairness and
            cruelty of a Kafkaesque bureaucracy and advocate for the voiceless.
          </p>

          </div>

          <p>
            Yet, Luiselli begins to unsettle this testimonial structure with her
            handling of the children's stories. Most are left unfinished, cut
            off in fragments, or answered with a simple "I don't know how it
            ends." She spends pages carefully recounting the story of the two
            Guatemalan sisters – their mother's journey to Long Island, their
            grandmother sewing phone numbers into their dress collars, and their
            family reunification at JFK airport. Through the extensive use of
            vivid details and particularity, Luiselli leads us to believe that
            there will be some sort of resolution or closure to the story. Yet,
            midway through the story, Luiselli abruptly stops: "I do not know if
            the two girls will be given relief." Why would Luiselli invest such
            narrative labor only to withhold the ending it seems designed to
            reach? What purpose does creating and then frustrating narrative
            expectations serve in an essay ostensibly advocating for these
            children?
          </p>

          <h2>The Economy of Words</h2>

          <p>
            To see how Luiselli builds our appetite for closure, we need to look
            at how her storytelling style transforms as the essay progresses.
            She begins her essay in a pared-down, almost stenographic style. In
            the courtroom, she tries to "look for general categories that may
            tip the legal scale in favor" and records answers like "I worked in
            the fields, ten or maybe fifteen hours a day. / The MS-13 shot my
            sister. She died. / Yes, my uncle hit me often. / No, my grandmother
            never hit us." These stories are stripped of connectivity. They read
            off like items in a ledger rather than a cohesive story. They show
            the implementation of an economy of words and use a matter-of-fact
            tone with phrases like "[s]he died" showing the use of the "barren
            terms" referred to earlier. There is no space for color, atmosphere,
            or subjectivity. The effect is that we hear voices reduced to
            evidence and lives flattened to satisfy the checkboxes demanded by
            the intake form.
          </p>

          <p>
            This flat style makes the sudden eruption of detail as seen in the
            stories of the Guatemalan sisters and of Manu all the more striking.
            She describes the five-year-old "undress[ing] a crayon and
            scratch[ing] its trunk with her fingernail" and Manu's honest
            comment that he would have coffee and snacks "if it's free." These
            details resist the economy of words earlier imposed, animating the
            children as full, irreducible individuals. This choice seems to
            oppose a system built to reward children who can package themselves
            for consumption by the legal system. Yet, even these fuller
            depictions refuse closure, denying the reader the comfort of a
            finished story.
          </p>

          <p>
            This frustration becomes especially apparent as Luiselli's daughter
            repeatedly asks "Tell me how it ends, Mamma." Just as the girl wants
            an ending to satisfy her curiosity, many readers are also
            conditioned to look for narrative payoff after so much detail. But
            Luiselli's answer – "I don't know how it ends" – refuses both
            requests.
          </p>

          <h2>Cultivating and Denying Closure</h2>

          <p>
            The essay's structure itself resembles this cultivation and denial
            through Luiselli's framing of her family's road trip alongside the
            children's stories. She builds anticipation through her children's
            repeated question "When will we get there? How many more hours?",
            creating a parallel between her family's journey toward a
            destination and our expectation of narrative resolution. This
            structural parallel becomes even clearer when Luiselli describes the
            news coverage: "Questions, speculations, and opinions flash-flood
            the news for the days that follow. What will happen to these
            children? Where are the parents? Where will they go next?" She
            presents herself and her readers as equally hungry for answers,
            equally positioned as consumers of the stories. She presents stark
            data – "eighty percent of the women and girls who cross Mexico to
            get to the US border are raped on the way" – which creates an
            expectation that individual stories will illuminate these
            statistics. Yet when she encounters actual children, she
            systematically refuses to satisfy this connection. The essay
            mentions "the bodies of seventy-two Central American migrants were
            found piled up inside a ranch in Tamaulipas" and asks "What did
            number seventy-two think when the seventy-first gunshot was heard?"
            This creates an anticipation that she would expand on individual
            experience within mass tragedy. But instead of providing that
            individual perspective, she shifts to think about abstract questions
            about accountability, again leaving readers with the uneasy void of
            incompleteness.

          <h2>Manu's Case: Open-Endedness as Preservation</h2>

          <p>
            Luiselli's treatment of Manu's case shows how open-endedness
            preserves human complexity against bureaucratic reduction. When we
            first meet Manu, his story seems to follow a clear trajectory toward
            legal resolution: he has documentation ("a folded piece of paper
            from his pocket. It's a copy of a police report he filed against
            gang members"), clear persecution narrative ("They kicked the door
            open and shot my brother"), and legal representation. Yet six months
            later, when Manu reveals "MS-13 in Hempstead wants him" and
            describes how "Barrio 18... beat his teeth out of his mouth," his
            story refuses fitting into simple boxes. The very system meant to
            protect him has placed him back in danger. Luiselli's refusal to
            resolve Manu's situation keeps his story alive. It allows the
            children to be more than what they have suffered.
          </p>

          <h2>The Extractive Logic of Reading</h2>

          <p>
            We begin to realize that through the essay's fragmented structure,
            the deliberate juxtapositions of the family's road trip with the
            children's stories, and the strategic refusal to provide closure
            suggests that Luiselli is doing more than exposing institutional
            cruelty. She presents the questionnaire not merely as a flawed tool
            but also as a predatory instrument of extraction that mines the
            children's life experiences. This process turns their identity into
            that of a transactional narrator, hollowing out their personality
            and replacing it with a strategic narrative of suffering. The
            child's own truth becomes secondary to its legal utility. Crucially,
            Luiselli frames the essay to expose the reader's own tendency to use
            such extractive logic when encountering the stories. We are
            conditioned to listen for "correct answers" that deliver narrative
            and emotional impact. Through this, Luiselli makes the act of
            reading itself unsettling and complicit.
          </p>

          <h2>Creating a Counter-Archive</h2>

          <p>
            Her response, and the essay's ultimate purpose, is to create a
            counter-archive: a space for the human stories the system deems
            worthless. By interspersing her exposé of the immigration system
            with apparently irrelevant details like her own family's road trip,
            the image of the "happy" deported children playing with balloons,
            and the view from a courtroom window, she tries to rehumanize the
            stories. This is why her refusal to end the stories and the title's
            glaring ask for such an ending is her most powerful strategy.
            Denying us the catharsis of closure is a form of protection for her
            subjects. It prevents their stories from being consumed and filed
            away. The essay champions the messy and inconclusive truth of
            experience against a machinery that seeks to compress it into a
            simple, useful, but ultimately false story.
          </p>

          <h2>Redefining Victimhood</h2>

          <p>
            Luiselli's essay tries to redefine how we understand victimhood by
            refusing to let trauma become the sum total of identity. Her
            description of the intake process reveals how the system reduces
            children to their "battle wounds": "So in the warped world of
            immigration... a correct answer is when a girl reveals that her
            father is an alcoholic who physically or sexually abused her."
            Against this logic, Luiselli insists on presenting children as
            complex individuals whose identities extend beyond their suffering.
            This approach challenges readers' expectations about how victims
            should behave and what stories deserve our attention. The essay
            suggests that true ethical reading requires remaining present with
            unresolved suffering rather than seeking the emotional satisfaction
            of concluded narratives. By denying catharsis, Luiselli tries to
            prevent the complacency that allows systemic violence to continue
            unchallenged, forcing readers to remain engaged with ongoing crises
            rather than filing these stories away as completed moral education.
